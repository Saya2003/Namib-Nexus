        <h2>üß™ What is Uranium?</h2>
        <p>
          Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive element found in rocks,
          soil, and water. It is the key fuel used in nuclear power plants to
          generate electricity. While it can be used for military applications
          (like nuclear weapons), its peaceful use in energy production is
          increasingly important as the world shifts toward low-carbon energy.

        <h2>üåç Section 1: Geological Types of Uranium Deposits</h2>
        <p>
          Uranium doesn‚Äôt occur randomly; it forms in specific geological
          environments over millions of years. These are categorized based on
          the type of rock, geological processes, and mineral concentrations.
        </p>

        <article id="types-1">
          <h3>1. Sandstone-Hosted Deposits</h3>
          <p>
            Transported by water through porous sandstone, uranium settles when
            reacting with organic material or chemicals like hydrogen sulfide.
            Often mined via In-Situ Recovery (ISR).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> Kazakhstan (Inkai), USA (Wyoming)

        <article id="types-2">
          <h3>2. Unconformity-Related Deposits</h3>
          <p>
            Found at the boundary between ancient rocks and sandstone. Extremely
            high-grade deposits (up to 20% U‚ÇÉO‚Çà). Underground mining is common.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Vein-Type Deposits</h3>
          <p>
            Uranium fills cracks in rocks (quartz/granite). Typically mined
            underground. Smaller but with variable grade.
          </p>

          <p>
            Found in igneous rocks like granite or pegmatites. Mined via
            open-pit or underground methods.
          </p>
          <p>

        <article id="types-5">
          <h3>5. Breccia Pipe Deposits</h3>
          <p>
            Formed in vertical collapsed rock structures by hydrothermal fluids.
            Mined underground.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> Arizona Strip (USA)
          </p>
        </article>

        <article id="types-6">
          <h3>6. Surficial Deposits</h3>
          <p>
            Found near the surface in calcrete or peat. Mined via shallow
            open-pits or heap leaching.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> Langer Heinrich (Namibia), Yeelirrie (Australia)

          <h3>7. Phosphorite Deposits (By-Product Uranium)</h3>
          <p>
            Extracted from phosphate rocks mined for fertilizer. Involves
            chemical industrial processing.
          </p>
